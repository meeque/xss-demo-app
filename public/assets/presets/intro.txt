Welcome to the XSS Demo App!

Enter your XSS attack into this Payload Input field!
Or, select one of the Payload Presets from the menu above.

Then, choose a Payload Output that processes your Payload Input.
Payload Outputs are the XSS Demo App's predefined examples of web application code.
Some Payload Outputs defend against XSS attacks, others are vulnerable to XSS.
It's up to you to find out which Payload Input can exploit the XSS vulnerability in a specific Payload Output.

Once you've found a suitable XSS Payload Input, you can run arbitrary JavaScript code.
For your convenience, the XSS Demo App provides a global JavaScript function named xss().
Invoke xss() and you will see a prominent alert message.
