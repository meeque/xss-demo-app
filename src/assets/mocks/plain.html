    <h1>XSS Demo: Plain HTML Mock</h1>
    <p>
        This is a plain HTML page mock.
        This page is statically served and contains no client-side JS code either.
        Therefore, this page is <strong>not</strong> vulnerable to XSS by itself.
    </p>
    <p>
        However, any other HTML document that is hosted on the same origin (protocol, host, port) can load this page and manipulate its DOM at will.
    </p>
    <p class="xss-challenge">
        Try it yourself by replacing this paragraph! For your convenience, you can access it through CSS selector <tt>p.challenge</tt>.
